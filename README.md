This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# About this repo
This is a simple project made with react/redux.  
The purpose of this app is to test stuff around react :
- react itself
- redux
- jest/enzyme
- different pattern

What it does is providing a simple interface to manage paint templates around Citadel color paints.  
Let's say you want a reminder about how you paint shoulders for your Blood Angels chapter like no other, this is made for it !
